Freeing up RAM by moving large pre-computed arrays to ROM (Flash memory)

This text applies to the ESP8266 platform using GCC, but is certainly 
applicable on any other platform and compiler.

The Wish project uses among others the AES code from the mbedtls
library. AES uses some large tables which hold pre-computed data.
Obviously we would like to store this kind of stuff in the ROM. How to
do that?

The initial situation was that the AES tables were pre-calculated at
ssytem startup, in RAM memory-based arrays. Storage for these arrays
were saved in the .bss segment. The bss segment is for statically
allocated tables, which are initialised to zero, such as your typical
globally defined arrays which are uninitialised.

You can see what symbols (globals, like variables, arrays, functions) 
exits and where they are allocated with objdump:

xtensa-lx106-elf-objdump -x build/app.out

(there's a lot of them so pipe to output to 'less' or 'grep')

You can also use: (from [1])
xtensa-lx106-elf-readelf -s ./out/build/app_0.out > /tmp/app-symbols.csv 

and sort the results in a spreadsheet - however I don't know how to get
the sections printed out with readelf so maybe objdump -x is better in
that sense. But readelf produces output which is more easy to use in a
spreadsheet!

Anyway:
First, we need to declare on mbdedtls config.h the AES_ROM_TABLES config
option. This disables the run-time generation of the tables, and enables
pre-calculated tables from one of the header files. It seems that GCC
correctly identifies these arrays as "read-only", and allocates
automatically them to .rodata segment. (obviously they do not end up in
.bss, since they now have pre-defined data)
This reduces the bss segment size, but does not actually decrease RAM 
usage at all! Why, you ask?  Well, because the .rodata segment is allocated 
by the linker script to RAM memory. So clearly we must do some more tricks 
to move the arrays to flash ROM.

Looking at the linker script (ld/eagle.app.v6.ld), we see that the flash
memory is called 'irom0'. Further, we note that the segment .irom0.text
is something that seems to stored to "irom0" memory.

We can tell GCC (or ld linker, actually) to allocate something to ROM by
using section attributes. For example, this would define a large array
to be saved in irom0.text segment:

int32_t __attribute__ ((section(".irom0.text"))) my_array[100] = { 
    /* initialisation here */ };

Obviosly, an array like this cannot be written to just like that, as it
is saved in flash ROM. Maybe you could use the flash r/w routines to
change the contents, but you would need to calculate somehow the actual
flash sector address first, based on the address of 'my_array' and the
mapping of flash memory to the address space. Doing this is outside the
scope of this text.

Arrays and objects saved in flash have an important restriction
regarding how they can be accessed on the ESP8266 platform. Flash can
only be read at addresses that are evenly divisible by 4 (in other words
they must be 4 byte aligned). This means in practice that you cannot use
a direct array reference (like: my_array[37]) unless the array element
is an (u)int32_t, or some other type whose size is n*4, n being a
natural number. If you must store odd-sized elements, you could use a 
special getter method that gets for example a byte from flash by reading
the whole 4-byte word containing the said byte, and filter out the byte
data. This is actually done by the ESP8266 spiffs flash r/w driver.

You should probably also set the aligned attribute to any object stored
in flash, by appending this string to the section attribute string:

__attribute__ ((aligned(4)))

Note that for this reason it probably is not a good idea to try to move
.rodata segment to flash (irom0), because the library routines assume
that string litterals can be accessed byte-by-byte.

Your other options:

You could save your array data to a file, and save that file to 
spiffs file system which you would flash to the system at the same time
as the the firmware is flashed. See README.spiffs_imaging for
information how to generate a spiffs filesystem image.
